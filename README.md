# Image Classification using CNN

A deep learning project for classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python with Keras and TensorFlow.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras / TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset
The model was trained on [Your Dataset Here] (e.g., MNIST / CIFAR-10 / custom images). Replace with actual dataset source if applicable.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Conv2D + MaxPooling
- Flatten
- Dense layers with ReLU and Softmax
- Compiled with `categorical_crossentropy` loss and `adam` optimizer

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `imageclassificationusingcnn.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Upload dataset and execute cells

## 📈 Results
- Training Accuracy: XX%
- Validation Accuracy: YY%
- Loss curve and accuracy plots available in the notebook
